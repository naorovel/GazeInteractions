    Function to turn a gaze_point as specified in the Tobii Stream Engine API to a pixel
    screen coordinate.

    https://developer.tobii.com/product-integration/stream-engine/#tobii_streamsh

    If the coordinate is outside [0.0, 1.0], then the nearest pixel on the screen will be used. 

    Note: If the gaze is outside the screen, then data will be narrowed in scope, and saccades
    off the screen will need to be captured in a different way. This function is for use for UI
    input, and may need to be expanded to include consideration for off-screen glances.

    @rtype: ScreenCoordinate
    @return: The screen coordinate corresponding to gaze_point on the primary monitor
        - (0, 0) is left upper corner of the screen.
